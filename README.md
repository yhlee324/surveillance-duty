# Surveillance Duty Organizer
This is a small project I worked on when I was serving in the Korean Army from 2022 to 2024. 



## About the Project
The code is designed to assist the the process of organizing surveillance duty shifts for my company. It first reads a text file containing the relevant information of the soldiers, such as their name, rank, or shifts taken in the previous week. It then writes  shifts for this cycle, a "fairness report," and the updated info of soldiers that could be used as input for the next cycle.



## Usage
Note: You can change the filename of the input/output text files in Organizer.java. 
1. Run `javac Organizer.java` to compile the Java Source files.
2. Run `java Organizer.java`
